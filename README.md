  Default license for your submission (MIT recommended).

- **.editorconfig**  
  Standardizes indentation, line endings, and character encoding across editors and platforms.

- **.gitattributes**  
  Ensures consistent handling of line endings, text, and binary files across different operating systems.

- **.gitignore**  
  Ignores build artifacts, OS files, IDE configs, and other non-essential files to keep the repository clean.

- **assets/**  
  Optional folder for images, icons, datasets, or other media used in the project.

- **demo/**  
  Place your demo video here (`demo.mp4`) or include a `DEMO.md` file linking to external videos (YouTube, Google Drive, etc.).

- **docs/**  
  Contains essential documentation:  
  - `OVERVIEW.md` â†’ Project overview and key features  
  - `SETUP.md` â†’ Instructions for installing dependencies and running the project

## âœ… Submission Guidelines

1. Use this template as the starting point for your repository.  
2. Ensure all required files and folders are included: `README.md`, `docs/OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, `demo/`, and `src/`.  
3. Fill in the `TEAM.md` file with your team membersâ€™ information.  
4. Link or include your demo video in the `demo/` folder.  
5. Optional: Include tests, additional documentation, or design notes in `docs/`.

## ðŸ“Œ Tips

- Keep your code and assets organized within `src/` and `assets/`.  
- Use `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes` to avoid formatting and line-ending issues.  
- Follow the folder structure strictly â€” it will make judging smoother and faster.

Good luck and happy hacking! ðŸš€
